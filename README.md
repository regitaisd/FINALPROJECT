FINAL PROJECT PLAN???? \n

My final project will be a simple, word/number unscrabble program \n
include iostream, include string\n
string /*word*/ for word \n
int choice for menu choice \n
int no for integer/number \n
there are no plans to add more amount of numbers/letters yet but for now it's 3 - 4 numbers/lettered word \n\n

THE POINT IS \n
the program shows how many anagrams you can make out of a word or\n
how many variations of numbers can you make with the numbers provided\n\n

cout what do we want to unscrabble today?\n
cout 1. word 2. number \n
cin choice\n

if choice is 1 then word, if choice is 2 then number\n
other options would give out an invalid response\n
then user enters the letters or numbers, the program will show the combinations you can do\n\n

EXTRA: an update log in txt form will be uploaded as well and it will\n
be updated as soon as i can with what i've done with the program
