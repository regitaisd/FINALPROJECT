FINAL PROJECT PLAN????
my final project would be a word-number unscrambling program. users are able to enter either a 3 to 5 lettered word or a 3 to 5 digit number, and are also able to see how many variations it can make.

HOWEVER: entering a word with more than 5 letters or numbers with more than 5 digits will not make the program work as it is not what it wanted. Decimals and negative numbers apply to this too.

how am i going to do this? 
-use mostly the basics, i'll use functions when necessary
-i'm also planning to add a return to menu option (this is temporary)
-(hopefully) make users be able to enter words with as many letters as possible or numbers with as many digits as possible (this is also temporary)

there might be changes to the plan, as this is just a plain draft

EXTRA: an update log in txt form will be uploaded as well and it will be updated as soon as i can with what i've done with the program

code/links references will be included, maybe soon
