FINAL PROJECT PLAN????
my final project would be a short quiz on several topics. kind of like the Jeopardy game we played in FEP...sort of.
planned subjects that i want to input so far are

*General Knowledge
Music
Mathematics
...TBA*

THIS IS NOT FINAL, however, i may still need to change them in a later time.
everyone will be given a set of 20-25 questions, with either 4 or 5 for each category.
each questions have 4 options and 3 chances to get the questions correctly

how am i going to do this? 
-use mostly the basics, i'll use functions when necessary
-if/else if/else might play a huge role in this
-i'm also planning to add a return to menu option (this is temporary)

there might be changes to the plan, as this is just a plain draft

EXTRA: an update log in txt form will be uploaded as well and it will
be updated as soon as i can with what i've done with the program

code/links references will be included, maybe soon
